The following things are what is needed to properly compile and run the TaskManage project:

Download MySQL ConnectorJ and JavaFX
    *scenebuilder is optional for JavaFX but very useful
    *when you extract the folders, it's probably easist to put them in the same folder
Change Project Structure
    *go to file->Project Structure->libraries-> click '+'
    *name library whatever you want, and add the lib folders of both ConnectorJ and JavaFX to it
    *Go to modules section
    *In dependencies tab, make sure to select the library
    *go to sources and make sure the resources folder is marked as a resources root
Edit Configurations
    *Make a new application, I just called mine TaskManage
    *add taskmanage.main.Main in the main text box
    *go to modify options, then add VM options
    *now properly add JavaFX functionality inside the VM options
        *add the path to the JavaFX lib and select chosen modules
        --module-path path/to/lib/folder --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml
