APPLICATION WINDOWS (Dashboard and 3 others--calendar, task view, task create)

The GUI for this project consists of a multitude of features for all necessary information to maximize the capabilities of the software for the user. We have added a home page that consists of a task summary that shows the completed tasks, ongoing tasks, and tasks that are overdue. We have also included a statistical graph that shows your performance in how far you are faring in completing your goals to help motivate the users to keep on going. On the left you see a basic layout of functions such as task creation, to develop new tasks, and calendar frame to view any long-term tasks you have scheduled out, and a task view frame to view the more in-depth settings of creating a task.
In the next figure, you see a more in-depth look at the sidebar of the first figure visualizing the task creation. The calendar function gives you access to more ability to navigate short and long-term goals while giving you the ability to edit or highlight the specific details of that day. Next, the task creation involves storing basic kinds of data about the task at hand, and to the right of that, you see the tasks that have recently been created.
