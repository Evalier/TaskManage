Current Tasks: (last updated 5/12)
Implement chosen screen source code files and push to main

Important Information:
Commit and push changes to GitHub at least once a week

We still have a high degree of freedom to implement the project as we see fit, just make sure when we change something from the proposal there is a good reason.

Try to use the same notation throughout the project
   My notation for the branches:
      If its for a screen
         screen-home-dashboard
         screen-calendar
      For a feature branch
         feature/home-dashboard
         superAmazingFeature/home-dashboard

WORKFLOW:
Create a personal branch
   Acts as a personal main
   I named mine dylan-main
   This is so that we have a place to push our changes to on the remote repository without fear of overwriting stuff on Main when we are not ready, and also have our work able to be viewed by others
   Personally I find it easier to use the IntelliJ UI. The branch information for checking out and creating new branches is at the top next to the name of the project
Create necessary individual branches
   Isolate chosen work
Work on source code and develop features
Commit code of the individual branches AND merge with personal branch
   CMI commands
      git add .                                      //stages all changes in current directory and sub directories
      git commit -m “message about changes made”
      git checkout personal-main                     //I find it easier to use the UI for checking branches out
      git merge screen-branch-name OR feature/branch-name
Push/merge personal branch with personal branch on GitHub
   CMI commands
      git merge TaskManage personal-main
      git push TaskManage personal-main              //basically same thing
When ready, merge remote personal branch with remote main
   Update personal branch and resolve any conflicts
      git checkout personal-branch
      git pull TaskManage main
      git checkout personal-branch
      git merge main
   Push updated branch
      git push TaskManage personal-branch
   Create a pull request (probably not needed at this stage)
   Review, approve, merge
When necessary, update elements of local repository with features from remote main
   Same process as updating before merging with remote main
   Ensure we are keeping up with changes from everybody else
